# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A web application for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **Streamlit** and **Logistic Regression**. This tool allows users to upload transaction data, predict fraudulent activities, and analyze transaction trends.

## Features
- **Fraud Detection**: Predict fraudulent transactions from uploaded datasets.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Analyze trends in fraud and transaction patterns.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive application built with Streamlit.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web application framework.
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification algorithm for fraud detection.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn`: Model training and evaluation.
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: Data visualization.
